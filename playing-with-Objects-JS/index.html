        // Practice iterating through an array of objects / dictionaries. 
        // Imagine that you are given an array of objects.  For example,
        // var users = [{name: "Michael", age:37}, {name: "John", age:30}, {name: "David", age:27}];
        // How would you print/log John's age?
        // How would you print / log the name of the first object ?
        // How would you print / log the name and age of each user using a for loop ? Your output should look something like this

        var users = [{ name: "Michael", age: 37 },
        { name: "John", age: 30 },
        { name: "David", age: 27 }];

        users.forEach((element, index, array) => {
            console.log(element.name + " - " + element.age)
        });
